    !IMPORTANT: THE ARRAY ARE ALWAYS DEFINED BY (COLUMN, ROW)
    !->This is structure is as follows:
    !The triangles are divided by their orientation, therefore we have two
    !kind of triangles -> Up
    !                  -> Down
    !Inside every triangle the nodes are stored as one dimension more of the array:
    !(Column, Row, Node)
    !Since we are in a triangle the codification of the nodes are not trivial, hence we
    !have defined it depending on the line that contains them (this is global,
    !it does not depend on the orientation of the triangle):
    !Numeration of the nodes
    !   For nodes in the sides:
    !   1ยบ -> /
    !   2ยบ -> _
    !   3ยบ -> \
    !   4ยบ -> Centered nodes (to allow working with CC and Mix, we in the code this will be denoted by
    !						 an "a" which is defined by a = size(Tri%UpUF,3) )
    !The X direction is the _ and the Y direction is the \ as a consequence our triangles numeration is the following:
    !
    !                           /\
    !                          /  \     <- Up (1,1,:)
    !                         /____\
    !                        /\    /\   <- Down (1,1,:)
    !                       /  \  /  \
    !         Up(1,2,:)->  /____\/____\ <- Up (2,2,:)
    !

    !Numeration and nomenclature, for internal meshed triangles:
    !                Xp3          Xp1 __l2__ Xp2
    !                / \              \    /
    !           l1->/   \<-l3      l1->\  /<-l3
    !              /_____\              \/
    !           Xp1  l2   Xp2           Xp3
    !
    !The way to acces the next triangles is the following:
    !Up triangles are surrounded by down triangles and viceversa
    !Taking this into account we realise that we have to act different deppending of our triangle:
    !Example with Up triangles: Up(2,3) will have the following     -> Down (2,2) -> One column less
    !                                                               -> Down (2,3) -> Same coordinates
    !                                                               -> Down (1,2) -> One row and one column less
    !
    !Example with Down triangles: Down(2,2) will have the following -> Up (2,3) -> One column higher
    !                                                               -> Up (2,2) -> Same coordinates
    !                                                               -> Up (3,3) -> One row and one column more
    !
    !->EXPLANATION OF THE ARRAYS FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL MULTIGRID WITH TRIANGLES
    !Ideas:
    !We have subdivided the triangles between up ones and down ones.
    !We need to store 4 diferent values for each node:
    !                                               - Values of our data in that node (U)
    !                                               - Right hand side of the equation (F)
    !                                               - Residual of our function in each node (Res)
    !                                               - An auxiliar that can store for example in problems time
    !                                                 dependency the previous value of (U)
    !
    !As we said previously we will access from and up triangle the down triangles. Therefore
    !in order to make our algorithms coherents, we don't want to distinguish between inner triangles
    !and triangles in contact with the boundaries. Hence, we will store our boundaries/overlap
    !with the down triangles.
    !Following the previous example we can see very easily that only the up triangles have contact
    !with the boundaries/overlap and as our stencil only have four points(next three triangles)
    !The example before presented would be stored as follows:
    !
    !   UpUF:                  DownUF: (size = number of down triangles in the largest column + 3)
    !                                    (If we want both to have the same numberation
    !                                    this matrix must start with 0,0)
    !       |0|f|f|                     |-|-|-|
    !       |u|0|f|                     |b|b|f|
    !       |u|u|0|                     |-|1|-|
    !
    !   f -> Second part of the equation
    !   b -> Boundaries/overlap
    !   u -> Values in the nodes
    !   - -> Empty value
    !NOTE FOR NODES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDES:
    !In this situation we will only work with up triangles and the stencils requiered are reduced to three.
    !The data will be stored as follows:
    !For each side there will be one array therefore, there will be three arrays to store all the nodes.
    !The overlap will be stored in UpUF in the position required, that are the diagonal, the colum(0) and
    !in the last row, each variable will use only two of this places.
    !NOTE:As here we are using vectors, the overlap must be stored with negative value.
    !
    !->Xp1,Xp2,Xp3: 1D array(2). The first component is the x position and the second is the y position.
    !               Xp2 is the coordinate with the highest x position
    !               Xp3 is the coordinate with the highest y position unless Xp2 has both the highest x and y,
    !                   then Xp3 will contain the coordinate with the second highest y
    !               Xp1 is the oder
    !->SizeUp/Down is the length of the largest column/row of the triangle. This is done because
    !in order to iterate we go from column 1 to the one previous to the diagonal
    !and from row 1 to Size + 1
    !
    !StencilCC is an array of doubles(3,3,7). Contains for each node the molecule of the multigrid
    !StencilSD is an array of doubles(3,3,3). Contains for each node the molecule of the multigrid
    !StencilMix is an array of doubles(3,3,:). Contains for each node the molecule of the multigrid
    !			The first three positions are for SD type nodes.

    !->Visited is a logical to store if that level has been visited already. Only useful for W and F cycles.
